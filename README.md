## What is Goock Games?
Goock Games is a platform with a variety of 1-on-1 classic games (i.e. Tic Tac Toe, Nim, and Pong), but with a twist. Instead of playing the game yourself, you have to code an algorithm to play the game. This algorithm will then be run against other players' algorithms and whoever wins will come on top. Players will have access to public leaderboards, which showcase the top performing algorithm of each game. Furthermore, players have the ability to "spectate" games. This means that they are able to watch their algorithms battle each other out, in a more traditional point of view. For example, for Tic Tac Toe, players will get to watch a 3 by 3 grid slowly have its cells populated by Xs and Os from none other than their very own algorithm. Goock Games is an excellent way for people to put their problem solving, critical thinking, and programming abilities together to use.

## Using Goock Games
If you want to try Goock Games, first make sure you have Python, npm, and Node.js installed on your computer. Then, you simply need to clone the repo! Once in the project, make sure you run `npm install` in both the root folder and the client folder as you will need to have all the node packages installed. From then on, all you have to do is run `npm start` in the client folder get the app up and running. In order to utilize all the functionality, you will also have to have the server, which can be done by running `node index.js` in the server folder. You will also need to have `matchup.py` run every time a new algorithm is submitted. Have fun with it!
